Laravel Starter Kit: Academic Project Description This Laravel Starter Kit functions as a fundamental boilerplate for developing web applications. It's a custom-built solution that integrates a comprehensive authentication system and a secure admin panel, both of which feature full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) capabilities.

The system employs a role-based access control model with two distinct user types: Admin and Supplier. The Admin possesses privileges, allowing for full user management, including the ability to view, edit, delete, and Change passwords for all accounts. The Supplier role is specialized for content management, specifically for the Product model, and can perform all CRUD operations on their own product data.

The user interface is constructed with Blade layouts to ensure structural consistency and reusability. The system also includes relevant Laravel packages to improve functionality and user experience. To maintain data integrity, the application features robust validation and error handling. The project adheres to a clean and organized code structure, which facilitates future maintenance and scalability. An .env.example file is provided to streamline the environment setup process.
